# EDGARServer
This project is a map from XBRL terms from the EDGAR API to usable datasets for machine learning. 
It is heavaly reliant on OOP and is predominantly a data processing system.
An example of binary outcome logistic regression is implemented in regression.py as the function logistic_regression_series()

The terms mapping is not extensive, and for practical use will have to be expanded.
